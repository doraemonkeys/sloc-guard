# Documentation Maintenance

**Maintenance Principle**: Keep concise, avoid redundancy, clean up outdated content promptly to reduce AI context usage.

When user completes a feature and requests doc updates, update these three files:

1. `docs/Implementation Plan.md` - Update module status table, check off completed tasks
2. `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Update Module Map, Key Types, Data Flow as needed
3. `docs/Requirements.md` - Only update if requirements changed
